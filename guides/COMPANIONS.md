# Companions

1. **Purpose**:
   - Companions are collectible, cute animals that serve as trophies and self-expression tools.
   - They also provide lightweight, passive gameplay buffs.
2. **Buffs and Abilities**:
   - Examples of Passive Buffs:
     - Increased resource generation (e.g., +5% wood/stone).
     - Better RNG for rare item rolls (e.g., +3% for rare items).
     - Reduced crafting time (e.g., -10%).
     - Daily bonus resource generation (e.g., +10 data fragments every 24 hours).
3. **Happiness System**:
   - Companions have a “happiness” level that impacts their buffs.
   - Happiness decreases gradually and is maintained through simple actions (e.g., feeding them or completing daily tasks).
   - Example: “Feed your Fox once every 24 hours to maintain maximum resource generation.”
4. **Progression**:
   - Companions can level up, improving their buffs or unlocking new abilities.
   - Leveling is tied to time or achievements, creating long-term progression goals.
   - Companions are obtained by hatching eggs in their UNNAMED. Eggs are obtained and are labelled for each animal they are.
